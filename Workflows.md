## Description
If there is any question, feel free to create an issue, or you can send email to me at juicego1123@gmail.com if you are a visitor without a github account.
## Youko's Works
* [**Github Raws**](https://workflow.is/workflows/12a17a3c23f34ee89b67ffaa79f46e4c)  
Use the sharing extension or clipboard input to get github raws.  
The input url is a file's, like this: `https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/blob/master/extension-scripts/qr-decoder.js`  
If you always get amazing githubs from short urls, add an action to expand them.  
JSBox users can replace the url scheme with `jsbox://create` , or you can also use "open in…" action.  
* [**TG Stickers**](https://workflow.is/workflows/450b4db38872403780dd3c580fb7cda4)  
There are two default ways to import the sticker pictures. Share an archive containing images to workflow, or choose multiple photos in your camera album. You can also change the input method. It depends on you.  
These images will automatelly fit into a 512x512 square so you can send them to [Telegram Stickers Bot](https://t.me/Stickers) for creating your own sticker packs.  
In addition, I recommend you to join my channel "[Sticker Gallery](https://t.me/StickerKolle)" which sharing lovely sticker packs. :)  
* [**Today's APOD**](https://workflow.is/workflows/ba546039db7a4ca98d2ee2f64cbfcd65)

Use NASA free open API to get latest Astronomy Picture of the Day in your [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). You can also apply for [a personal API](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html).  
You should use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) according to the actions I have set up. Ingredient settings are like these:  
The first trigger set on "If a workflow triggers `Your Trigger Name`, then send photo to `Your target chat`".

The second one is simpler with "If a workflow triggers `Your Trigger Name`, then send message to `Your target chat`", only one ingredient required.

You may ask why I don't use IFTTT directly to get the APOD in Telegram. As you know, a photo's caption is limited to 200 characters by Telegram so I can't send the picture with its explanation at the same time by directly using IFTTT. What's worse, two seperate applet linking NASA's APOD and IFTTT directly may not function timely. For example, you may receice the explanation an hour after receiving the picture.  
And accutally, I share this workflow to help you set up your own APOD pushing. Using workflow, you can get APOD in a different way you prefer.
